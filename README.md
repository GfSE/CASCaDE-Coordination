# CASCaDE-Coordination
An environment to keep issues, decisions and other documentation for the coordination of the CASCaDE submission team.
CASCaDE is a project to standardize such collaboration in terms of data format and ontology.

The work-package 0 (WP-0) lead by Torsten Schmied and Uwe Kaufmann are responsible for the content.

Conventions:
- Issues and proposals to discuss are documented using the 'issues' section.
- Documentation (link list, meeting reports, decisions etc.) are maintained in the 'wiki' section.
